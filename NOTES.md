## How to calculate your life in months.

* Step 1. Take your birthdate (ex. 1/1/2000)

* Step 2. Take today's date (ex. 8/28/2022)

* Step 3. First calculate age: 22 years old.

* Step 4. Multiply it by 12 (12 months in a year): 264

*  Step 5. Then add the months completed (ex. 7, since the example date has not yet completed her 8th month of the year)

TOTAL MONTHS: 271

From there, it is easy to calculate your percentage, too. Simply move the decimal to the left one digit. 

TOTAL PERCENTAGE: 27.1%

For clarity, we round up to 1000.
