lifeTrack is an app puts your `life in time` into perspective. It shows you how many months you have lived so far based on `average life expectancy`. It is positive, supportive, inspirational. To make all of your months worthwhile.  

>Unlike a 'death counter' which predicts your death-date by life expectancy, lifeTrack offers features to IMPROVE your productivity and quality of life, month by month, to inspire and set fire to flame in your life.  

Check out the lifeTrak blog here. Read both the inspiration and the techincal review. 

Check out the lifeTrak GitHub here. 

### Features

- Convert your annual age (how many years you've lived) into months (how many calendar months you have lived). The conversion is novel, but allows users to perceive their life within a 1000 month context. 
- Offer a 'notebook' to save personal goals which can be finished within a month.  
- Allow users to look up average life-expectancy in months by state. 
- Offer suggestions for activities to do for the user,
